Binary Trees in Java

Overview

This repository contains Java implementations of various Binary Tree operations. The code covers fundamental concepts, recursive and iterative traversals, and advanced operations like finding subtrees, calculating diameters, and level-order traversal.

Key Concepts

Tree Structure: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST)

Traversals: Preorder, Inorder, Postorder, Level Order

Operations:

Insert, Delete, Search

Height & Diameter Calculation

Identifying Subtrees

BFS & DFS

Implementations

1. Preorder Tree Construction

This method constructs a binary tree from a given array following preorder traversal.

2. Level Order Traversal

This method prints the tree level by level using a queue-based approach.

3. Subtree Identification

Checks whether a given tree is a subtree of another tree by comparing nodes recursively.

4. Diameter Calculation

Calculates the longest path between any two nodes in the tree.

How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/GowdaHemannth/BinaryTrees.git

Open the project in your Java IDE.

Compile and run the test cases.

Future Improvements

Convert to an iterative approach for certain operations.

Implement Balanced Tree algorithms.

Add Graphical Visualization using JavaFX.
